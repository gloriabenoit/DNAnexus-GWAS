## Overview

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on the use of DNAnexus to performe a GWAS on the UKBiobank data.
We will run everything from the command line, but will monitor our jobs on the project's web page.

This tutorial assumes that you already have a researcher account on the UKBiobank site, and have access to a DNAnexus project.
If not, please create an account [here](https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/signup), and once it has been validated, create an account on [UKB-RAP](https://ukbiobank.dnanexus.com/register) to access DNAnexus.

## Requirements

To follow this tutorial, you will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
