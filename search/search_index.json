We will run everything from the command line, but will monitor our jobs on the project's web page. This tutorial assumes that you already have a researcher account on the UKBiobank site, and have access to a DNAnexus project. If not, please create an account here , and once it has been validated, create an account on UKB-RAP with your UK Biobank credentials to access DNAnexus. This tutorial will guide you through every step needed in order to perform a basic GWAS using whole genome sequences for chromosome 1 to 22 for both PLINK2 and regenie . In order to parallelize the analyses, we will perform 22 different GWAS, one for each chromosome, and combine the results locally to reduce cost. This tutorial is written for Linux operating systems.

For more information on the data available, you can run the following command: dx ls \"/Bulk/Whole genome sequences\" On DNAnexus, when a job is executed, a worker is spun up in the cloud, then the job's code and inputs are downloaded to that worker and exectuted. This is the standard behavior, but inputs can also be mounted to avoid their downloading costs. PLINK2 PLINK2 can read both BGEN and PLINK format. Therefore, we have 4 ways of inputing genetic data: File format Mounted BGEN No BGEN Yes PLINK No PLINK Yes After some trial and error, we have found that using the BGEN format without mounting it was the quickest way to perform a GWAS using PLINK2. Downloading and translating BGEN files locally was quicker than downloading or mounting the PLINK files. Therefore, in this tutorial, we will input BGEN files directly. The path to the genetic data is the following: \"/Bulk/Whole genome sequences/Population level genome variants, BGEN format - interim 200k release/\" . Additionnal data In order to run our GWAS, apart from the genetic and sample data, we need 3 additionnal files: The phenotype (for instance, BMI) The ids of individuals we wish to keep (for instance, white british) The covariates to use (for instance, 18 genetic principal components, the sex and the age) Theses files can either be uploaded directly to your projects using dx upload , or created using DNAnexus data. This tutorial will guide you through the second option. All three files will be uploaded to your current dx repertory ( WKD_<your-name> if you are closely following this tutorial). If you want to upload them somewhere else, you can either move directory with dx cd before uploading, or use the --path or --destination option to specify the DNAnexus path to upload the files. Phenotype To extract the phenotype that we want, we first need to download all available data-fields in our dataset. You will need the record-id , which is the id of the .dataset file at the root of your DNAnexus project. On your project's web page, you can find the id by selecting the .dataset file and searching for the ID in the info panel that appears on the right. Please note, when running the extract_dataset command you might encounter a ('Invalid JSON received from server', 200) error. If this happens, you simply need to rerun the code. dx extract_dataset <record-id> -ddd --delimiter \",\" This command outputs 3 files: <app-id>.data_dictionary.csv contains a table with participants as the rows and metadata along the columns, including field names (see table below for naming convention) <app-id>.codings.csv contains a lookup table for the different medical codes, including ICD-10 codes that will be displayed in the diagnosis field column (p41270) <app-id>.entity_dictionary.csv contains the different entities that can be queried, where participant is the main entity that corresponds to most phenotype fields To make it easier, you can rename theses files to a shorter name like ukbb . rename <app-id> ukbb app* We first need to get the field name of the phenotype(s) we want to extract. As an example, we will extract the BMI index ( 21001 ), but you can extract any number of phenotypes. For the main participant phenotype entity, the Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP) uses field names with the following convention: Type of field Syntax for field name Example Neither instanced nor arrayed p<FIELD> p31 Instanced but not arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE> p40005_i0 Arrayed but not instanced p<FIELD>_a<ARRAY> p41262_a0 Instanced and arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE>_a<ARRAY> p93_i0_a0 This means one phenotype ID can actually have multiple data field. For example, BMI has four instances. The following python script will extract the phenotype that you wish, and every array or instance associated. \"\"\" Extract phenotype(s) from UKBB based on field ID(s). \"\"\" import os import subprocess import pandas as pd # Input FILENAME = \"ukbb.dataset.data_dictionary.csv\" OUTPUT = \"pheno_extract.csv\" DATASET = \"<record-id>\" FIELD_ID = [21001] # BMI id def field_names_for_ids(filename, field_ids): \"\"\" Converts data-field id to corresponding field name.

Running the previous code will first delete pheno_extract.csv if it's present, allowing for the extraction to happen. PLINK and regenie use the same formatting for the phenotype file, with a single exception : the code for missing values. Apart from this, both need to duplicate the individuals ids and only keep the first instance for our phenotype. More information on phenotype files formatting can be found here for PLINK2 and here for regenie. \"\"\" Format phenotype file. \"\"\" import pandas as pd # Input FILENAME = \"pheno_extract.csv\" PHENOTYPE = \"BMI\" SOFTWARE = 'p' # for PLINK2 or 'r' for regenie. def format_phenotype(filename, phenotype, software): \"\"\" Save phenotype according to software format.

This is only a suggestion, and might not work for more specific phenotypes. You can now upload the formated phenotype file. dx upload plink_BMI.txt dx upload regenie_BMI.txt For the sake of this tutorial, we upload two files: one for each type of formatting. Individual ids Running a GWAS on a specific population helps reduce the bias caused by population stratification. It is therefore an important step. To filter out individuals based on their ethnic background, we can use the phenotype extraction script and the data-field 21000 . You simply need to replace the following line: FIELD_ID = [21000] # ethnic background id This field uses the 1001 data encoding . In this code, 1001 means white british which is the main ethnic group, and the one we want to select. pop_code=1001 pop_name=\"white_british\" population=\"pheno_extract.csv\" awk -F \",\" -v var=\"$pop_code\" '$2~var{print $1,$1}' $population > $pop_name.txt This command outputs 1 file: white_british.txt contains the participants IDs of the white british ethnic background You can now upload the ids of your individuals. dx upload white_british.txt Covariates The genetic principal components from the UKBB individuals are stored in the 22009 data field. We could use our phenotype extraction algorithm, but for some reason, it is not working. Therefore, we will use another script. We will use 20 variables as covariates: the first 18 PCA components, the sex ( 31 ) and the age ( 21003 ) of individuals. However, you can extract whatever you want as covariates. More information on covariates files formatting can be found here for PLINK2 and here for regenie. record_id=\"<record-id>\" field_names=\"participant.eid,participant.eid,\" for i in {1..18} do field_names+=\"participant.p22009_a$i,\" done field_names+=\"participant.p31,participant.p21003_i0\" # Sex and age dx extract_dataset $record_id --fields $field_names --delimiter \",\" --output covariates.txt echo -e \"FID,IID,PC1,PC2,PC3,PC4,PC5,PC6,PC7,PC8,PC9,PC10,PC11,PC12,PC13,PC14,PC15,PC16,PC17,PC18,Sex,Age\" > file.tmp tail -n+2 covariates.txt >> file.tmp awk -F , '$3!=\"\"' file.tmp > covariates.txt # Remove ind with no PC data sed 's/,/\\t/g' covariates.txt > file.tmp mv file.tmp covariates.txt This command outputs 1 file: covariates.txt contains the first 18 PCA components, the sex and the age of all participants You can now upload the covariates file. dx upload covariates.txt","title":"Input files"},{"location":"input/#input-files","text":"","title":"Input files"},{"location":"input/#genetic-data","text":"On DNAnexus, whole genome sequences data are saved in multiple formats: BGEN format ( .bgen and .sample ), PLINK format ( .bed , .bim and .fam ) or pVCF format ( .vcf.gz.tbi ), among others.
