We will run everything from the command line, but will monitor our jobs on the project's web page. This tutorial assumes that you already have a researcher account on the UKBiobank site, and have access to a DNAnexus project. If not, please create an account here , and once it has been validated, create an account on UKB-RAP with your UK Biobank credentials to access DNAnexus. To setup your first project, please check the official documentation on the matter . This tutorial will guide you through every step needed in order to perform a basic GWAS using whole genome sequences for chromosome 1 to 22 for both PLINK2 and regenie . In order to parallelize the analyses, we will perform 22 different GWAS, one for each chromosome, and combine the results locally to reduce cost. As an example, we will perform a linear regression on the BMI index ( 21001 ) using whole genome sequencing data , specifically the interim 200k release ( \"/Bulk/Whole genome sequences/Population level genome variants, BGEN format - interim 200k release/\" ). However, you can use any data that you need, simply keep in mind that paths need to be changed in the scripts. This tutorial is written for Linux operating systems. Commands may vary accross operating systems. The official GWAS guide using Alzheimer's disease and the official github page for a GWAS on the Research Analysis Platform using regenie were useful material when writing the regenie section . If you want to try other tools on DNAnexus, we recommend the following github page: ukb-rap-tools by Phil Greer . Structure The tutorial is separated into four main sections: Fondamentals for first-time use of DNAnexus ( Getting started , About jobs ) Necessary files for GWAS input ( Input files ) Running a GWAS ( Using PLINK2 , Using regenie ) Generating plots from results ( Visualizing results ) Please note, the PLINK2 and regenie sections are independant of each other and can be done separately. However, you will need to follow first the Getting started and Input files pages to make sure you have everything necessary to their completion. Requirements To follow this tutorial, you will only need Python 3 . Durations and costs Please note, when first using your account you have an initial credit of \u00a340. Running all of this tutorial with the same instance and priority as us might go over this budget. If it is not done already, your project should be billed to a wallet which is different from your initial credit. Please check the official documentation if you are unsure on how to proceed. Jobs cost will be computed based on the official UKB RAP Rate Card (v3.0). Please remember the cost and duration of a job depends on the instance and priority used. Execution time may also vary for the same instance. Input files The input files extraction/upload is done locally and does not cost anything. Please be aware that storing files onto DNAnexus will result in a monthly cost. You may check its current value in the SETTINGS tab on your project's web page, or compute it using the UKB RAP Rate Card . Using PLINK2 The PLINK2 GWAS will run 22 different jobs (one per chromosome). With our chosen instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) using a high priority, the whole GWAS will take about 200 minutes (3h20) and cost around \u00a317.04 (for a total execution time of 2341 minutes). With the same instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) using a low priority, if no jobs are interrupted, it will cost only \u00a34.56 for the same time. Please note that it is most unlikely for jobs to be uninterrupted. In our experience, the whole GWAS using this instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) with a low priority and some interruptions has cost around \u00a39.30 altough it took almost 7h30 to complete from start to finish (with no failed jobs). Using regenie The regenie GWAS runs a total of 47 different jobs: 22 jobs for the quality control (one per chromosome) 2 jobs for the merging and QC of merged data 1 job for regenie's step 1 (SNPs contribution estimation) 22 job for regenie's step 2 (regression, one per chromosome) To optimize your GWAS's overall time, you can perform the QC in parallel to every other step beside step 2 (for which it is needed). The rest needs to be done in order. With our chosen instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) using a high priority, the whole GWAS will take about 700 minutes (11h40, when running each step in order) and cost around \u00a321.46 (for a total execution time of 2948 minutes). With the same instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) using a low priority, if no jobs are interrupted, it will cost only \u00a35.74 for the same time. You can find the details about the jobs run in the following table: Action Time Execution time Cost (high) Cost (low, no interruption) QC 2h39 30h 13.10 3.50 Merge 51min 51min 0.37 0.10 Merge QC 10min 10min 0.07 0.02 Step 1 7h10 7h10 3.13 0.83 Step 2 48min 10h57 4.78 1.28 Please note that it is most unlikely for jobs to be uninterrupted. In our experience, the whole GWAS using this instance (mem1_ssd1_v2_x16) with a low priority and some interruptions has cost around \u00a312.57 (without accounting for failed jobs, of which there were a few). Since most steps need to be done in order, it also took a total of 54h35 to complete the GWAS from start to finish (over multiple sessions since some jobs failed). If you count the failed jobs, you can add \u00a35.36 to the total cost, and 12h04 to the total time taken.

Among them, you can find whole exome sequencing data ( /Bulk/Exome sequences/ ) or whole genome sequencing data ( /Bulk/Whole genome sequences ). We will use the latter. Whole genome sequencing data is available in multiple formats: BGEN format ( .bgen and .sample ), PLINK format ( .bed , .bim and .fam ) or pVCF format ( .vcf.gz.tbi ), among others. For more information on the data available, you can run the following command: dx ls \"/Bulk/Whole genome sequences\" As written on the About jobs page , input files can be either downloaded or mounted to the worker. After some trial and error, we have found that using the BGEN format without mounting it was the quickest way to perform a GWAS using PLINK2. Downloading and translating BGEN files to a suitable format locally was quicker than downloading or mounting the PLINK files. Therefore, in this tutorial, we will input BGEN files directly, for both the PLINK2 and the regenie GWASs. The path to the genetic data is the following: \"/Bulk/Whole genome sequences/Population level genome variants, BGEN format - interim 200k release/\" . Additional data In order to run our GWAS, apart from the genetic and sample data, we need 3 additionnal files: The phenotype (for instance, BMI) The ids of individuals we wish to keep (for instance, white british) The covariates to use (for instance, 18 genetic principal components, the sex and the age) Theses files can either be uploaded directly to your projects using dx upload , or created using DNAnexus data. This tutorial will guide you through the second option. All three files will be uploaded to your current dx repertory ( gwas_tutorial if you are closely following this tutorial). If you want to upload them somewhere else, you can either move directory with dx cd before uploading, or use the --path or --destination option to specify the DNAnexus path to upload the files. Phenotype To extract the phenotype that we want, we first need to download all available data-fields in our dataset using Python. Please note, when running the extract_dataset command you might encounter a ('Invalid JSON received from server', 200) error. If this happens, you simply need to rerun the code. \"\"\" Extract dataset. \"\"\" import dxpy import subprocess DATASET = dxpy.find_one_data_object(typename='Dataset', name='app*.dataset', folder='/', name_mode='glob')['id'] cmd = [\"dx\", \"extract_dataset\", DATASET, \"-ddd\", \"--delimiter\", \",\"] subprocess.check_call(cmd) Once completed, we want to rename the output file to a more manageable name like ukbb . The rename command is a built-in tool on many Linux distributions. However, if you don't have it, you can install it with sudo apt install rename . dataset_name=$(basename *.data_dictionary.csv | sed -e \"s/.data_dictionary.csv//\") rename $dataset_name ukbb $dataset_name* Combining these two scripts outputs 3 files: ukbb.data_dictionary.csv contains a table with participants as the rows and metadata along the columns, including field names (see table below for naming convention) ukbb.codings.csv contains a lookup table for the different medical codes, including ICD-10 codes that will be displayed in the diagnosis field column (p41270) ukbb.entity_dictionary.csv contains the different entities that can be queried, where participant is the main entity that corresponds to most phenotype fields We first need to get the field name of the phenotype(s) we want to extract. As an example, we will extract the BMI index ( 21001 ), but you can extract any number of phenotypes. For the main participant phenotype entity, the Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP) uses field names with the following convention: Type of field Syntax for field name Example Neither instanced nor arrayed p<FIELD> p31 Instanced but not arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE> p40005_i0 Arrayed but not instanced p<FIELD>_a<ARRAY> p41262_a0 Instanced and arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE>_a<ARRAY> p93_i0_a0 This means one phenotype ID can actually have multiple data field. For example, BMI has four instances. The following python script will extract the phenotype that you wish, and every array or instance associated. Please note, the file computed is temporary, it is not necessary to rename it since it's not the final phenotype file. \"\"\" Extract phenotype(s) from UKBB based on field ID(s). \"\"\" import os import subprocess import pandas as pd import dxpy # Input DATASET = dxpy.find_one_data_object(typename='Dataset', name='app*.dataset', folder='/', name_mode='glob')['id'] FILENAME = \"ukbb.data_dictionary.csv\" OUTPUT = \"pheno_extract.csv\" FIELD_ID = [21001] # BMI id def field_names_for_ids(filename, field_ids): \"\"\" Convert data-field id to corresponding field name.

Running the previous code will first delete pheno_extract.csv if it's present, allowing for the extraction to happen. PLINK2 and regenie use the same formatting for the phenotype file, with a single exception : the code for missing values. Apart from this, both need to duplicate the individuals ids and only keep the first instance for our phenotype. More information on phenotype files formatting can be found here for PLINK2 and here for regenie. \"\"\" Format phenotype file. \"\"\" import pandas as pd # Input FILENAME = \"pheno_extract.csv\" PHENOTYPE = \"BMI\" SOFTWARE = 'p' # for PLINK2 or 'r' for regenie def format_phenotype(filename, phenotype, software): \"\"\" Save phenotype according to software format.

This is only a suggestion, and might not work for more specific phenotypes. You can now upload the formated phenotype file. dx upload plink_BMI.txt dx upload regenie_BMI.txt For the sake of this tutorial, we upload two files: one for each type of formatting. Individual ids Running a GWAS on a specific population helps reduce the bias caused by population stratification. It is therefore an important step. To filter out individuals based on their ethnic background, we can use the phenotype extraction script and the data-field 21000 . You simply need to replace the following line: FIELD_ID = [21000] # ethnic background id This field uses the 1001 data encoding . In this code, 1001 means white british which is the main ethnic group, and the one we want to select. pop_code=1001 pop_name=\"white_british\" population=\"pheno_extract.csv\" awk -F \",\" -v var=\"$pop_code\" '$2~var{print $1,$1}' $population > $pop_name.txt This command outputs 1 file: white_british.txt contains the participants IDs of the white british ethnic background You can now upload the ids of your individuals. dx upload white_british.txt Covariates The genetic principal components from the UKBB individuals are stored in the 22009 data field. We could use our phenotype extraction algorithm, but for some reason, it is not working. Therefore, we will use another script. We will use 20 variables as covariates: the first 18 PCA components, the sex ( 31 ) and the age ( 21003 ) of individuals. However, you can extract whatever you want as covariates. More information on covariates files formatting can be found here for PLINK2 and here for regenie. record_id=\"<record-id>\" field_names=\"participant.eid,participant.eid,\" for i in {1..18} do field_names+=\"participant.p22009_a$i,\" done field_names+=\"participant.p31,participant.p21003_i0\" # Sex and age dx extract_dataset $record_id --fields $field_names --delimiter \",\" --output covariates.txt echo -e \"FID,IID,PC1,PC2,PC3,PC4,PC5,PC6,PC7,PC8,PC9,PC10,PC11,PC12,PC13,PC14,PC15,PC16,PC17,PC18,Sex,Age\" > file.tmp tail -n+2 covariates.txt >> file.tmp awk -F , '$3!=\"\"' file.tmp > covariates.txt # Remove ind with no PC data sed 's/,/\\t/g' covariates.txt > file.tmp mv file.tmp covariates.txt This command outputs 1 file: covariates.txt contains the first 18 PCA components, the sex and the age of all participants You can now upload the covariates file. dx upload covariates.txt","title":"Input files"},{"location":"input/#input-files","text":"","title":"Input files"},{"location":"input/#genetic-data","text":"On DNAnexus, large items, like genetic data, are stored in the Bulk folder at the root of your project.

For the main participant phenotype entity, the Research Analysis Platform (UKB-RAP) uses field names with the following convention: Type of field Syntax for field name Example Neither instanced nor arrayed p<FIELD> p31 Instanced but not arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE> p40005_i0 Arrayed but not instanced p<FIELD>_a<ARRAY> p41262_a0 Instanced and arrayed p<FIELD>_i<INSTANCE>_a<ARRAY> p93_i0_a0 This means one phenotype ID can actually have multiple data field. For example, BMI has four instances. The following python script will extract the phenotype that you wish, and every array or instance associated. Please note, the file computed is temporary, it is not necessary to rename it since it's not the final phenotype file. \"\"\" Extract phenotype(s) from UKBB based on field ID(s). \"\"\" import os import subprocess import pandas as pd import dxpy # Input DATASET = dxpy.find_one_data_object(typename='Dataset', name='app*.dataset', folder='/', name_mode='glob')['id'] FILENAME = \"ukbb.data_dictionary.csv\" OUTPUT = \"pheno_extract.csv\" FIELD_ID = [21001] # BMI id def field_names_for_ids(filename, field_ids): \"\"\" Convert data-field id to corresponding field name.

Running the previous code will first delete pheno_extract.csv if it's present, allowing for the extraction to happen. PLINK2 and regenie use the same formatting for the phenotype file, with a single exception : the code for missing values. Apart from this, both need to duplicate the individuals ids and only keep the first instance for our phenotype. More information on phenotype files formatting can be found here for PLINK2 and here for regenie. \"\"\" Format phenotype file. \"\"\" import pandas as pd # Input FILENAME = \"pheno_extract.csv\" PHENOTYPE = \"BMI\" SOFTWARE = 'p' # for PLINK2 or 'r' for regenie def format_phenotype(filename, phenotype, software): \"\"\" Save phenotype according to software format.

However, be aware that it is not mandatory to complete the tutorial. For more detailed information, you can check the official documentation for a quickstart or about the key concepts of the platform. Execution On DNAnexus, when a job is executed, a worker is spun up in the cloud, then the job's code and inputs are downloaded to that worker and executed. This is the standard behavior, but inputs can also be mounted to the worker (accessed dynamically) to avoid their downloading costs. Inputs Since jobs are run on workers, you need to manually specify every file used as input. To add a file as input, you need to use the -iin option to your dx run command. The path to your file needs to be absolute so that there is no confusion as to where it is located. When mounting your files, you don't need to input them manually anymore. You simply need to add /mnt/project/ before your absolute path in the code. Instances To choose an instance for your job is to choose a specific worker on which your code will be executed. Instances have 3 main metrics: The number of cores (individual processing units) The memory capacity (components used for short-term data retention) The storage capacity (components used for long-term data retention) You might have no clue on what ressources your job needs to run properly, the simplest course of action is to start with a small instance and increase its capacities if you encounter any errors. Please check the Errors when running section if you don't know how to interpret your error message. Please note, this tutorial uses the same instance for every job. Depending on the data you want to use, you might need a bigger instance. If your goal is full optimization, then you might prefer a smaller one. All of this is up to you. To specify the instance you chose, you need to add the --instance-type option to your dx run command. For more information on instances, check the official documentation on instance types . Instances costs can be found on the UKB RAP Rate Card . Priority Jobs can have three level of priority: high means your job will be completed once the ressources are available normal means your job will wait for 15min to run in a low priority, and if no ressources are availables by then, will run in a high priority low means your job will start once the ressources are available, but may be interrupted if high priority jobs need them Although a high priority assures for job completion, it is also pricier than a low priority one. Please note, this tutorial will only run low priority jobs to reduce costs. To specify the level you chose, you need to add the --priority option to your dx run command. For more information on priorities, check the official documentation on job priority . Priority costs can be found on the UKB RAP Rate Card (where high refers to On-demand prices while low refers to Spot prices). Tags Tags, although optional, are very pratical when using DNAnexus regularly. They act as keywords associated to a job, and help if you need to navigate the MONITOR tab. You can find more information in the Monitoring section . To add a tag to your job, you need to add the --tag option to your dx run command. Time and cost limits By default, a job will result in an error if its execution time exceeds 30 days. Please note that this value may vary across apps. During this tutorial, no jobs will exceed this limit. Setting a cost limit is optional, but can be useful. For instance, when running a low priority job, it can ensure that possible interruptions won't add up causing the cost to rise by stopping the job early. It may also be of use if you don't know the time your job will take, and therefore can't compute the total cost. Either way, it is useful to avoid spending too much on a single job. To specify a cost limit, you need to add the --cost-limit option to your dx run command. For more information on limits, check the official documentation on time limits or on cost and spending limits . Monitoring You can monitor your jobs directly on your project's web page in the MONITOR tab. On this page, they are sorted in ascending order of launch date (the latest comes first). Basic information about the job is displayed, like its name, duration, cost, etc ... A job has 3 possible states: Done indicates that the job has completed successfully Waiting indicates that the ressources needed to run this job are not available yet, it will start once they are Failed indicates the job has failed due to an error Once a job is completed (either Done or Failed ), you will receive an email updating you of said completion. It will also appear in the Notifications tab (bell icon in the top right corner). Filtering jobs After running a lot of jobs, you might find your MONITOR page to be quite crowded. This is especially true with this tutorial where some jobs are run for each of the 22 chromosomes. To find a specific job, you can filter out the MONITOR page using specific values like the state or the ID of the user who launched the execution, for instance. In this tutorial, all jobs have specific tags which help with filtering. By default, tags are not used in filtering on the MONITOR page, you need to add them in the Filter settings tab (three stacked bars in the top right corner). Please note, in this tutorial, jobs are tagged with the software used (plink or regenie), the phenotype (BMI), the step of the analysis (QC, GWAS, Merge, Step 1 and 2) and lastly the chromosome number (c1 to 22) if jobs are separated per chromosome. Errors when running A failed job running on DNAnexus has only 3 main errors (apart from errors in the code): Warning: Out of memory error occurred during this job. Warning: Low disk space during this job. The machine running the job was terminated by the cloud provider This tutorial will explain the reason for those errors, and what you can do to avoid them. Out of memory If the cause of failure is the following: Error while running the command (please refer to the job log for more information). Warning: Out of memory error occurred during this job. You need to choose an instance with a bigger memory. The memory infix in the instance is mem . For more information on instances, refer to the Instances section . Low disk space If the cause of failure is the following: Error while running the command (please refer to the job log for more information). Warning: Low disk space during this job. You need to choose an instance with a bigger storage. The storage infix in the instance is ssd or hdd . For more information on instances, refer to the Instances section . Interruption limit (only for low priority) Jobs with a low priority can be interrupted if their ressources are needed by high priority jobs. A low priority job can be interrupted at most 10 times, then it will result in the following error: The machine running the job was terminated by the cloud provider You simply need to restart your job, either on the same instance or another one, if the one used is too popular. Others If the error is unclear to you, check the log of your job.

The basic commands like ls , cd or mv all have equivalents to run on the DNAnexus architecture rather than the local one, simply add dx before them. A quick way to check the difference is to run the same command on both architecture: ls will lists the files in your current directory , as you probably already know dx ls will lists the files in your DNAnexus current directory , which should be the root of your project if you are first starting (with the Bulk and Showcase metadata folders) You can find the official documentation for all dx commands we will use here .
